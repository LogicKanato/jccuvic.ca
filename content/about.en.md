Here you can find some information about our club you may have!
If there is something you can't find here to contact us!

## What is the Japanese Culture Club?
We are a club made up of Japanese students and students interested in Japanese culture. We host a variety of events in a laid back setting. Whether you know the language or not we welcome everyone regardless of ability.

## When was the Japanese Culture Club established?
The current form of the Japanese Culture Club was established in May 2017, however prior to this a similar organization was present at UVic.

## Is the Japanese Culture Club strictly about Japanese Culture?
Not at all! We chose this name as we believe it welcomes anyone who might be interested or involved in all aspects of Japan and Japanese culture.
This may range from Japanese students and Japanese language learners. 

We hope to provide a fun, inclusive and beneficial environment for all. If you have any concerns or suggestions on how we can best accomplish this, please let us know. 

## Do you operate during the summer semester?
Sometimes! It all depends on the leadership’s summer schedule so it’s better to check back later or email us closer to the summer semester to get a better idea of what we’re doing. 

## What kind of events do you offer?
Excellent question! We offer a variety of events and are always looking to expand. Some of our events include:
- Terrace House Viewing
- Language Exchange
- Equinox Event
- Hiking
- Karaoke
- Dinner


## I would like to help out! Where do I get in contact about this?
You can drop us an message through out contacts forms (at the top of the page). We’re always looking for more volunteers and help in any capacity.

## This website is pretty cool, who made it and how?
Realistically nobody probably asked this but I'm adding it anyhow. This website is built using the Hugo platform and hosted on Github.
You can find the source code on our Github repository here! We don't pay anything to run this website so overall it's quite effective.
If you're a club at UVic I highly suggest this!
