# Japanese Culture Club
This repository contains the source code / content for the Japanese Culture Club website at the University of Victoria. It is developed on the Hugo static site generation platform. Due to nature of this club, we have added multilingual support. 

The website itself is hosted as a **Github Pages** website.

## About Japanese Culture Club
We are a club based at the University of Victoria located in British Columbia. Despite the naming, we are not solely dedicated to _cultural_ aspects of Japan. Thankfully we have a website detailing who we are and what we do!

Despite being hosted on Github, we are not a technology orientated club.
