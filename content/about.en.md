If there is something you can't find here to contact us!

## What is the Japanese Culture Club?

## When was the Japanese Culture Club established?
The current form of the Japanese Culture Club was established in May 2017, however prior to this a similar organization was present at UVic.

## Is the Japanese Culture Club strictly about Japanese Culture?
Not at all! We chose this name as we believe it welcomes anyone who might be interested or involved in all aspects of Japan and Japanese culture.
This may range from Japanese students and Japanese language learners. 

We hope to provide a fun, inclusive and beneficial environment for all. If you have any concerns or suggestions on how we can best accomplish this, please let us know. 

## Do you operate during the summer semester?

## What kind of events do you offer?
Excellent question!

## I would like to help out! Where do I get in contact about this?


## This website is pretty cool, who made it and how?
Realistically nobody probably asked this but I'm adding it anyhow. This website is built using the Hugo platform and hosted on Github.
You can find the source code on our Github repository here! We don't pay anything to run this website so overall it's quite effective.
If you're a club at UVic I highly suggest this!
